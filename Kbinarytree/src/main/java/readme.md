This is an implementation of a binary tree in java

This contains all of the necessary functions such as insert, remove, find, and find minimum
It does not contain functions such as print tree and walk tree that other binary tree implementation might include

Shout out to W3schools becuase i mixed up queue and priority queue and totally broke my code for a while
